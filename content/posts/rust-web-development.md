# Building Modern Web Apps with Rust

Rust's safety guarantees and performance make it an excellent choice for web development.
Let's explore why Rust is becoming increasingly popular for building web applications.

## Safety First

Rust's ownership system prevents common bugs:

- No null pointer dereferences
- No data races
- Memory safety without garbage collection

## Performance

Rust's zero-cost abstractions mean you don't pay for what you don't use.
This results in extremely fast web applications that can compete with
hand-optimized C++ code.
